# Design Notes:
This is built upon the Valve provided 3D model of the visor and is intended to provide a way to cool the headset and/or the user. No electronics are provided, however wiring of the fans is trivial and plenty of internal space is provided.  
The fans slip into the slots on the top of the bracket and are retained by internal tabs. Optional caps, which are seperate files, can be snapped onto the top to cover the gap to improve looks. The bracket itself utilizes the same locations pins of the stock visor, which means magnets must be used.  
This was designed around the Noctua 40mm fans, which have rubber bumpers and are a little bit thiccer than standard 40mmx10mm fans. As such, if you use stock fans, you may find them to be a bit loose. Nothing a little double sided foam tape can't fix!  
Finally, this does violate the Sensor Inclusion Zone of the Index, which means it could theoretically affect tracking performance. A photo showing this is in the root of this directory.  

# Printing Notes:
I would *not* reccomend printing this using ABS, or any warp-prone filament. The locatins pins of the Index are very small and very distant from each other, which means even a small amount of part warp will throw off the alignment. PLA or PETG would be me reccomendation here. Of course, if it does warp, that double sided foam tape can save you once again.  
This has a flat bottom and is designed to be printed "upright." It will still require supports, however none on visible surfaces.

# BOM
You will need to print one of each file.  
These are the reccomended fans: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NEMGCIA/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_.JGiDbBDF39J2  
Use 1/8"x1/8" axially magnetized cylinder magnets, such as K&J #D22-N52.
